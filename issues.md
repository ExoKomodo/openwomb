# Issue Tracker

## Important Links

- [Github issues](https://github.com/exokomodo/openwomb/issues)

### Why?

Sick of not having issues co-local to the codebase, and this allows for more freeform planning and discussion, before dumping it into a PR or official issue. Also allows for platform-agnostic issue handling if we ever move off of Github.
