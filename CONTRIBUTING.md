## Technical Knowledge Prerequisite

- Understand the [Learn OpenGL tutorial up to and including this lesson](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Hello-Triangle)

## What can I work on?

Check out the [open issues file](./issues/open.md) to understand what work needs to be done.

## Why is there an issue tracker in the codebase and in our SCM solution?

Github does provide nice linking to issues for PRs and for the community to add issues to the project without having code access. The issues markdown files in the repo should be represented in Github as well, but are usually of higher priority and more immediately available to be worked on.
